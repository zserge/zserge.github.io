instrument their long-running apps with metrics to see if there are or were any
problems and if the system behaves as expected.</p><p>There are various metric types, but most common ones are counters, gauges and
histograms.</p><h2 id=metric-types>Metric types</h2><p>Counter is simply an increasing number. You may use counters to track the
number of served requests, number of errors, and so on. If you are only
interested to see how many times a certain event has happened during the given
time frame - use a counter.</p><p>Counters are probably the simplest metrics and the only information they
provide is a single number - counter value.</p><p>Gauge is also a number, but it may go up and down. You may use gauges to
track the memory usage, CPU load, temperature and other measured values.</p><p>Unlike counters, gauges often track not only their current value, but also
their mean, minimum and maximum values for each time interval.</p><p>However, mean is not always the right characteristic to look at. In practice
there are many cases when percentiles are more meaningful that a mean. To track
percentiles histogram metrics are used.</p><p>For those who are unaware of percentiles - it is a number such that a certain
percentage of values fall below that number. Here&rsquo;s a <a href=https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/why-averages-suck-and-percentiles-are-great/>good
explanation</a> when percentiles could be more useful than averages.</p><p>The most typical use case is tracking response times. For example, 95th
percentile of the response times shows the maximum response time of the 95% of
the requests.</p><h2 id=implementation>Implementation</h2><p>I like explaining things by showing how they work. All the code below is
simplified and the real implementation is slightly different (here we don&rsquo;t
focus on thread safety, division by zero errors etc).</p><p>Let&rsquo;s consider a generic meter. What can it do? It can accept an incoming
numerical value, one at a time, or it can be reset back to its zero state.</p><pre><code class=language-go>type Metric interface {
	Add(n float64)
	Reset()
}
</code></pre><p>There are two approaches to do metircs. One is to record every single event and
run queries each time to calculate the metrics. It&rsquo;s the most precise and
flexible approach, although it&rsquo;s time-consuming and needs more storage. Another
is to calculate metric values on the fly. It often uses less memory and is good
enough for most use cases, so we will go this way.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s start with the counter, since it is probably the easiest metric to
implement:</p><pre><code class=language-go>type Counter float64
func (c *Counter) Add(n float64) { *c = *c + Counter(n) }
func (c *Counter) Reset() { *c = 0 }
</code></pre><p>Gauge needs to track mean, min and max values. To calculate rolling mean we
need to count the number of events and their sum value:</p><pre><code class=language-go>type Gauge struct {
	count int
	sum   float64
	min   float64
	max   float64
}
func (g *Gauge) Reset() { g.count, g.sum, g.min, g.max = 0, 0, 0, 0 }
func (g *Gauge) mean() float64 { return g.sum / g.count }
func (g *Gauge) Add(n float64) {
	if n &lt; g.min { g.min = n }
	if n &gt; g.max { g.max = n }
	g.count++
	g.sum = g.sum + n
}
</code></pre><p>Finally, histograms. There seems to be no easy way to build precise histograms
without remembering all the data entries. However there are some algorithms to
construct approximate histograms on the fly.</p><p>One such algorithm has a fixed number of bins, puts a new incoming value into
an individual bin and when there are too many bins - it merges two most similar
ones.</p><pre><code class=language-go>type bin struct {
	value float64
	count float64
}
type Histogram struct {
	bins  []bin
	total uint64
}
func (h *Histogram) Reset() { h.bins, h.total = 0, nil }
func (h *Histogram) Add(n float64) {
	defer h.trim()
	h.total++
	newbin := bin{value: n, count: 1}
	// Insert new bin with a single value into the sorted array of bins
	for i := range h.bins {
		if h.bins[i].value &gt; n {
			h.bins = append(h.bins[:i], append([]bin{newbin}, h.bins[i:]...)...)
			return
		}
	}
	h.bins = append(h.bins, newbin)
}
func (h *Histogram) trim() {
	for len(h.bins) &gt; maxBins {
		// Find two adjacent bins with the closest values
		d := float64(0)
		i := 0
		for j := 1; j &lt; len(h.bins); j++ {
			if delta := h.bins[j].value - h.bins[j-1].value; delta &lt; d || j == 1 {
				d = delta
				i = j
			}
		}
		// Merge bins
		count := h.bins[i-1].count + h.bins[i].count
		merged := bin{
			value: (h.bins[i-1].value*h.bins[i-1].count + h.bins[i].value*h.bins[i].count) / count,
			count: count,
		}
		// Remove the second bin
		h.bins = append(h.bins[:i-1], h.bins[i:]...)
		h.bins[i-1] = merged
	}
}
</code></pre><p>This approach may not be the most precise, but it shows the overall picture of
how your data is distributed.</p><h2 id=timelines-and-multiple-metrics>Timelines and multiple metrics</h2><p>Once we&rsquo;ve implemented individual metrics - we can easliy build a timeline.
Timeline is a slice of buckets, where each bucket contains metric values for
one time slot. Timeline is rotated as time goes.</p><p>Also, it is often helpful to store timelines with multiple precisions. E.g. to
store one month of data with hourly precision and 6 hours of data with 30
seconds precision.</p><p>Since all metrics share a common interface - a combination of metrics can also
implement the same interface.</p><p>I won&rsquo;t provide actual implementations here, since they are really trivial.
To construct a metric there will be thee constructor functions: <code>NewCounter</code>,
<code>NewGauge</code> or <code>NewHistogram</code>. If no parameters are given - you will get a
single meter. You may also provide a number of precision strings to get
historical timelines of the given metric type. Precision strings look like
&ldquo;30m1s&rdquo; which means &ldquo;I want a timeline for 30 minutes of historical data with 1
second precision&rdquo;:</p><pre><code class=language-go>// A meter that keeps gauges for 30 days, 48 hours and 15 minutes of time with
// different precision:
m := metric.NewGauge(&quot;30d1h&quot;, &quot;48h5m&quot;, &quot;15m1s&quot;)
...
m.Add(someValue)
</code></pre><h2 id=expvar-and-web-interface>expvar and web interface</h2><p>Now we can construct metrics and push data. Two questions remain: how to access
metrics throughout your app code and how to actually read metric data.</p><p>Go provides an infamous <code>expvar</code> package to keep &ldquo;exposed&rdquo; public variables.
This variables can be read using a builtin HTTP endpoint <code>/debug/metrics</code> as a
JSON. I think it is a good idea not to reinvent the wheel and just integrate
out metrics with <code>expvar</code>. It is done by simply implementing a <code>String()</code>
method that prints metric data as a JSON string.</p><p>In addition to that, <code>expvar</code> also provides a simple API to register metric and
to get it, although some type casting is needed:</p><pre><code class=language-go>// Register metrics
expvar.Publish(&quot;num_errors&quot;, metric.NewCounter(&quot;15m10s&quot;))
expvar.Publish(&quot;latency&quot;, metric.NewHistogram(&quot;5m1s&quot;, &quot;15m30s&quot;, &quot;1h1m&quot;))

// Measure time and update the metric
start := time.Now()
...
expvar.Get(&quot;latency&quot;).(metric.Metric).Add(time.Since(start).Seconds())

// Update counter
expvar.Get(&quot;num_errors&quot;).(metric.Metric).Add(1)
</code></pre><p>I like using standard libraries as much as possible, but I also believe that
visual representation of data is better than reading plain JSON. So this
metrics package includes an opinionated web UI:</p><pre><code class=language-go>http.Handle(&quot;/debug/metrics&quot;, metric.Handler(metric.Exposed))
</code></pre><p>Here&rsquo;s how it looks like:</p><p><img src=/images/metrics-web-ui.png alt="Web interface"></p><p>On some graphs there are three lines. Of gauges the black line is the mean,
while gray lines are min and max. For histograms the black line is 99th
percentile, while gray lines are 90th and 50th percentiles.</p><p>The web UI uses no javascript and is very fast even if the number of metrics is
high.</p><h2 id=summary>Summary</h2><p>You may find all the source code at <a href=https://github.com/zserge/metric>https://github.com/zserge/metric</a>. It&rsquo;s very
small, a single file of ~300 lines of code and a few more lines for the user
interface. The library has no external dependencies and it&rsquo;s really
featherweight.</p><p>If you are building something big and it should scale well - consider using
real tools such as Prometheus, InfluxDB or StatsD. But for smaller projects if
you want to avoid wasting time to configure all those tools - feel free to use
this package, the setup is no harder than just importing a package and you can
start tracking you metrics almost immediately.</p><p>Of course, if you found an issue or have a suggestion - don&rsquo;t hesitate to drop
me a line or open an issue!</p><p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this article.
